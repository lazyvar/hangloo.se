Lightweight Markup Languages
============================
According to **Wikipedia**:
> A [lightweight markup language](http://is.gd/gns)
is a markup language with a simple syntax, designed
to be easy for a human to enter with a simple text
editor, and easy to read in its raw form.

Some examples are:
* Markdown
* Textile
* BBCode
* Wikipedia
Markup should also extend to _code_:

```
10 PRINT "I ROCK AT BASIC!"
20 GOTO 10
```
